| 19 Feberury 2025 | Microsoft | Microsoft announced their first quantumn processor "Majorana1" on 19 Feb 2025.  This make quatum state existes in themory into an applicable state in a controlled environment.  And Microsoft clamins that the Majorana1 can create and control the quatum states in the processor that make quatum computing become possible. | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9911d5f-396f-460d-a253-c790b5e6351e" width=70% height=70%>
| 18 March 2025 | Nvidia | On 18 Mar 2025, Nvidia is working on a computer that combines AI, super-computing and quantum in one machine to rule them all. This will be born in the newly revealed Nvidia Accelerated Quantum Research Center (NVAQC). | |
| 19 March 2025 | DWave | D-Wave announced that they did a simulation in the property of magnetic materials using its quantum computer and solved the problem in 20 minutes.  It would require nearly one million years, and more energy than the entire world utilizes over the course of a year on the traditional supercomputer. | |
