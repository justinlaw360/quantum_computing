# 量子計算 Quantum Computing
As of March 27, 2025, one of the recent hot topics, besides Deepseek, Groke3, and Manus, is definitely the breakthrough in Quantum Computing.


# Quantum Mechanics in Layman's Terms
Many have heard the term "Quantum" from fiction, where it is depicted as a mysterious but powerful substance that can change the world from the ground up. Part of the reason it seems so mysterious to the general public is that it cannot be easily explained using classical physical principles. Without a strong background in physics and mathematics, one may find it difficult to understand.

I am neither a physicist nor a mathematician, but I hope to share my limited knowledge here (putting on my helmet first). You can easily find a lot of research papers and articles about Quantum Mechanics. If you are interested in this topic, I highly recommend doing some academic homework. In fact, it has been a topic of interest since the time of Albert Einstein. As everyone knows, Einstein refused to accept randomness; he believed everything could be explained deterministically, hence his famous quote, "God does not play dice with the universe." However, Einstein was one of the scientists who discovered the indeterministic properties of Quantum Mechanics.

## Uncertainty behavoir 
One consequence of the basic quantum formalism is the uncertainty principle. This states that no matter how a quantum particle is prepared or how carefully experiments upon it are arranged, it is impossible to have a precise measurement of both its position and momentum at the same time.

## Quantum entanglement
Quantum entanglement is one of the strangest phenomena in the universe. It is the idea that particles of the same origin, which were once connected, always stay connected. Even if they separate and move far apart in time and space, they continue to share something beyond a mere bond — they shed their original quantum states and take on a new, united quantum state which they maintain forever. This means if something happens to one particle, it affects all the others with which it’s entangled.

## Quantum superposition
Superposition is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, describing the condition in which a quantum system can exist in multiple states or configurations simultaneously. Classical bits can exist in two possible states, typically labeled as "0" and "1". In contrast, because a qubit is a quantum mechanical system, it can exist in the “0” state, the “1” state, or any state that is a linear combination of 0 and 1. Importantly, the state of superposition can be maintained only while a quantum system is unobserved. Once measured, a quantum system in a state of superposition "collapses" into one of the basis states.

For a concrete example of how this might work if superposition could exist in the everyday world, imagine a coin that is flipped and lands on a table. In classical mechanics — and in the everyday world as we know it — the coin ends up in a state of either heads or tails. In a quantum mechanical system, the coin could be both heads and tails at the same time, but only until someone or something observes it or measures it. In this analogy, once observed, the coin would take on the state of either heads or tails.

## Why Quantum Superposition Matters
Quantum superposition isn’t just a mind-bending concept for the sake of it; it has real-world applications. For instance, in quantum computing, qubits (quantum bits) leverage superposition to perform complex calculations at speeds that classical computers can’t match.

Additionally, in quantum cryptography, superposition is used to create secure communication channels. It ensures that any eavesdropping attempts will disrupt the quantum state, alerting the parties involved.

In 2025, scientists in China transmitted encrypted images a record 12,900 kilometers, paving the way for quantum messaging anywhere on Earth. This involved sending pulses of laser light that are each in a ‘superposition’, where they exist at once in two quantum states, representing 1 or 0. By comparing the settings that the sender uses with those used by the receiver to measure the pulses, the two parties can work out a selection of measured 1s or 0s to use as a secure key. If an eavesdropper tries to intercept the message, this disturbs the quantum states and creates noise, revealing that the key has been compromised.
