# Quantum Computing
As the time of writing, 21 Mar 2025, one of recent hot tpoics, beside Deepseek, Groke3 and Manus, is definitely the breakthrough of Quantum Computing.


# Quantum mechanic in layman terms
Many heard the name "Quatumn" from fictions that it is a mysterious but powerful substances and it can change the world from the round up.  Part of the reason it is so mysterious to common people is that it cannot be explained easliy with classical physical princple.  One without a strong phyisc and math background, may find it is difficult to understand.  

I am not neither an physician nor mathematics, but I do hope trying my best to share what my limit knowlege here (put my hemlet first). You can easily find a lot of research papers and aricles about Quantum, if you are intereted in this topic, I highly recommend you do some homeworks in acadmeic ways.  In fact, it is a topic since the time of Albert Einstein.  As all knows, Albert Einstein refuses to accept randomness, he believes everything can be explainable, or deterministic and so he has his famous quotes "God does not play dice with the universe". However, Einstein is one of the scientists discovered the indeterministic property in Quantum mechanic.

## Uncertainty behavoir 
One consequence of the basic quantum formalism is the uncertainty principle. This states that no matter how a quantum particle is prepared or how carefully experiments upon it are arranged.  It is impossible to have a precise for a measurement of its position and also at the time for a measurement of its momentum.

## Quantum entanglement



# Quantum mechanic
Quantum mechanic describes the behavior of matter and of light.

| 19 Feberury 2025 | Microsoft | Microsoft announced their first quantumn processor "Majorana1" on 19 Feb 2025.  This make quatum state existes in themory into an applicable state in a controlled environment.  And Microsoft clamins that the Majorana1 can create and control the quatum states in the processor that make quatum computing become possible. | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9911d5f-396f-460d-a253-c790b5e6351e" width=70% height=70%>
| 18 March 2025 | Nvidia | On 18 Mar 2025, Nvidia is working on a computer that combines AI, super-computing and quantum in one machine to rule them all. This will be born in the newly revealed Nvidia Accelerated Quantum Research Center (NVAQC). | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bacc7e8-5eb7-47f2-8421-83bed764a4b5" width=70% height=70%> |
| 19 March 2025 | DWave | D-Wave announced that they did a simulation in the property of magnetic materials using its quantum computer and solved the problem in 20 minutes.  It would require nearly one million years, and more energy than the entire world utilizes over the course of a year on the traditional supercomputer. | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f71959c6-b2f6-4ce8-a223-52beb588cc44"  width=70% height=70%> |
