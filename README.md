# 量子力學淺談 Quantum Mechanics in Layman's Terms
許多人從小說中聽過“量子”這個詞，認為它是一種神秘但強大的物質，可以從根本上改變世界。部分原因是它無法用經典物理原理輕易解釋。沒有很強的物理和數學背景的朋友們可能會覺得難以理解。

我既不是物理學家也不是數學家，但我希望能分享我有限的知識（先戴上頭盔，未必完全準確。）你可以在互聯網上輕鬆找到許多關於量子的研究論文和文章。如果你對這個話題感興趣，我建議你學習研究一下。事實上，這個話題自愛因斯坦時代以來就一直存在。眾所周知，愛因斯坦拒絕接受隨機性；他相信一切都可以被確定性地解釋，因此他有一句著名的話：“上帝不會擲骰子決定宇宙的命運。”然而，愛因斯坦是發現量子力學不確定性特性的科學家之一。

Many have heard the term "Quantum" from fiction, where it is depicted as a mysterious but powerful substance that can change the world from the ground up. Part of the reason it seems so mysterious to the general public is that it cannot be easily explained using classical physical principles. Without a strong background in physics and mathematics, one may find it difficult to understand.

I am neither a physicist nor a mathematician, but I hope to share my limited knowledge here. You can easily find a lot of research papers and articles about Quantum Mechanics in Internet. If you are interested in this topic, I highly recommend doing some academic homework. In fact, it has been a topic of interest since the time of Albert Einstein. As everyone knows, Einstein refused to accept randomness; he believed everything could be explained deterministically, hence his famous quote, "God does not play dice with the universe." However, Einstein was one of the scientists who discovered the indeterministic properties of Quantum Mechanics.

## 不確定性原理 Uncertainty behavoir 
量子力學其中一個基本原理，是"不確定性原理"。就是說無論如何準備量子粒子或如何仔細安排實驗，都不可能同時精確測量其位置和動量。
One consequence of the basic quantum formalism is the uncertainty principle. This states that no matter how a quantum particle is prepared or how carefully experiments upon it are arranged, it is impossible to have a precise measurement of both its position and momentum at the same time.

## 量子糾纏 Quantum entanglement
量子糾纏是宇宙中最奇怪的現象之一。它的意思是同源的粒子，即使分開並在時間和空間上移動得很遠，它們仍然保持某種超越普通聯繫的關係——它們放棄了原有的量子態，並採取了一種新的、統一的量子態，並永遠保持這種狀態。這意味著如果一個粒子發生了變化，與之糾纏的所有其他粒子也會受到影響。 最近有一項研究發現，量子之間以每Attosecond進行信息交換。Attosecond是小數18個零之後的1秒。
Quantum entanglement is one of the strangest phenomena in the universe. It is the idea that particles of the same origin, which were once connected, always stay connected. Even if they separate and move far apart in time and space, they continue to share something beyond a mere bond — they shed their original quantum states and take on a new, united quantum state which they maintain forever. This means if something happens to one particle, it affects all the others with which it’s entangled.

## 量子疊加 Quantum superposition
疊加是量子力學中的一個基本概念，描述了量子系統可以同時存在於多種狀態或配置中的情況。一般我們應用在電腦上1 Bit可以存在於兩種可能的狀態，通常標記為“0”和“1”。相比之下，因為量子比特是量子力學系統，它可以存在於“0”狀態、“1”狀態，或0和1的線性組合中的任何狀態。重要的是，疊加狀態只能在量子系統未被觀察時保持。一旦被測量，處於疊加狀態的量子系統會“塌縮”到其中一個基態。

舉一個具體的例子來說明如果疊加可以存在於日常世界中會怎樣，想像一枚硬幣被拋起並落在桌子上。在經典力學——以及我們所知的日常世界中——硬幣最終會處於正面或反面狀態。在量子力學系統中，硬幣可以同時處於正面和反面狀態，但只有在有人或某物觀察或測量它之前。在這個比喻中，一旦被觀察，硬幣就會處於正面或反面狀態。我明白這是一個非常奇怪，一時間難以理解概念。
Superposition is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, describing the condition in which a quantum system can exist in multiple states or configurations simultaneously. Classical bits can exist in two possible states, typically labeled as "0" and "1". In contrast, because a qubit is a quantum mechanical system, it can exist in the “0” state, the “1” state, or any state that is a linear combination of 0 and 1. Importantly, the state of superposition can be maintained only while a quantum system is unobserved. Once measured, a quantum system in a state of superposition "collapses" into one of the basis states.

For a concrete example of how this might work if superposition could exist in the everyday world, imagine a coin that is flipped and lands on a table. In classical mechanics — and in the everyday world as we know it — the coin ends up in a state of either heads or tails. In a quantum mechanical system, the coin could be both heads and tails at the same time, but only until someone or something observes it or measures it. In this analogy, once observed, the coin would take on the state of either heads or tails.

## 為什麼量子疊加很重要 Why Quantum Superposition Matters
量子疊加不僅僅是一個令人費解的概念；它有現實世界的應用。例如，在量子計算中，量子比特利用疊加來以傳統計算機無法匹敵的速度進行複雜計算。 此外，在量子密碼學中，疊加被用來創建安全的通信通道。它確保任何竊聽企圖都會擾亂量子態，從而提醒相關方。

2025年，中國科學家傳輸了加密圖像，創下了12,900公里的紀錄，為地球上任何地方的量子消息傳遞鋪平了道路。這涉及發送每個處於“疊加”狀態的激光脈衝，它們同時存在於兩個量子態中，代表1或0。通過比較發送者使用的設置與接收者用來測量脈衝的設置，雙方可以計算出一組測量的1或0作為安全密鑰。如果竊聽者試圖攔截消息，這會擾亂量子態並產生噪音，揭示密鑰已被破壞。

Quantum superposition isn’t just a mind-bending concept for the sake of it; it has real-world applications. For instance, in quantum computing, qubits (quantum bits) leverage superposition to perform complex calculations at speeds that classical computers can’t match. Additionally, in quantum cryptography, superposition is used to create secure communication channels. It ensures that any eavesdropping attempts will disrupt the quantum state, alerting the parties involved.

In 2025, scientists in China transmitted encrypted images a record 12,900 kilometers, paving the way for quantum messaging anywhere on Earth. This involved sending pulses of laser light that are each in a ‘superposition’, where they exist at once in two quantum states, representing 1 or 0. By comparing the settings that the sender uses with those used by the receiver to measure the pulses, the two parties can work out a selection of measured 1s or 0s to use as a secure key. If an eavesdropper tries to intercept the message, this disturbs the quantum states and creates noise, revealing that the key has been compromised.
